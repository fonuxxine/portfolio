                <div>
                    <p>ReCoV-2gether is an app developed for the communities at the University of Toronto with an aim to raise awareness about the latest Covid-19 information in the Toronto neighbourhood, provide mental health resources and cultivate a platform where meaningful stories are shared and encouraged. Hosting eleven podcasts with guests coming from different backgrounds, gathering articles written by members of the university sharing their two cents on a passion topic, comparing different data sets to draw in important Covid-19 information, the app strives to be a safe space for reliable information, helpful resources and stories sharing in the time of many changes.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Android users can download the app here.</p>

                <h2>Challenges</h2>
                <p>One of the challenges we faced was time management. Although we had a planned schedule, we were not able to completely follow it due to unexpected circumstances. It was difficult to align our schedules to meet weekly. The biggest challenge we had to face was developing the mobile application. For many of us, this was our first time using Flutter. Throughout the entirety of the project, we spent time learning how to use Flutter and researching different technologies to help with our process. This includes but is not limited to, user interface design using Figma, Google Cloud platform, Flutter packages, APIs, and web scraping. We also faced a huge hurdle of finding a way to build for IOS. Only two of us had a Mac computer, so we had to work on the schedule of the person with the Mac to build our application for the Apple App Store.  Due to multiple bugs that needed to be fixed, and waiting for our REB proposal to be approved, we had to delay deploying the application to the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.</p>

                <h2>Learnings</h2>
                <p>We learnt a variety of different skills including project management, research, programming technologies and podcast hosting. Additionally, we further developed existing skills such as communication and teamwork. For project management, we learnt how to schedule meetings, create agendas, set timelines and manage task completion. For research, we worked with a faculty supervisor to submit an REB and design a beta testing study. For programming technologies, we learnt how to use Flutter, dart language, and the graphic packages in Flutter to build a mobile app from scratch. Two of our members hosted a podcast for the first time, and recruited guests, planned scripts, edited the episodes and published them to the various podcast platforms.</p>

                <h2>Looking back and ahead</h2>
                <p>Throughout the period of the project, we were able to develop and improve on our teamwork skills, especially that we worked on the project remotely from our homes. Through the aforementioned challenges we faced, we were able to hone our programming skills, learn new technologies, and even go through a research process. We grew together as a team and learned so many things as we faced challenges and achieved successes together that would not have been possible without this opportunity.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Moreover, the contribution we’re hoping to make to the community would far exceed what we have learned ourselves, and that’s what makes this experience worthwhile and valuable.</p>
